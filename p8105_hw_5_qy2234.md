# Problem 1

``` r
## load in the given dataset and clean the names
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%

  - Based on the spaghetti plots made, we can see that there is not
    really an increase or a decrease for the control group. The
    observations for individuals fluctuate a lot but basiclly stay the
    same across the period of the experiment. There is not a significant
    enough trend. On the other hand, for the experimental group,
    although individual data still fluatuates a lot, there is a obvious
    increasing trend as the experiment proceed. In general, we see a
    higher average reading for the individuals in the experimental group
    compared to the ones from the control
group.

  - Based on the plot we made, we see a linear relation between the true
    value of beta 2 and power of the test, in other words, as the true
    beta 2 increases, the power of the test also increases.
