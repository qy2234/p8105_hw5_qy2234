  - Based on the spaghetti plots made, we can see that there is not
    really an increase or a decrease for the control group. The
    observations for individuals fluctuate a lot but basiclly stay the
    same across the period of the experiment. There is not a significant
    enough trend. On the other hand, for the experimental group,
    although individual data still fluatuates a lot, there is a obvious
    increasing trend as the experiment proceed. In general, we see a
    higher average reading for the individuals in the experimental group
    compared to the ones from the control group.
